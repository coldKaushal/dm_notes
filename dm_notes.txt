data mining:	non trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful infromation from large data set of databases

clustering as preprocess:
	summarization: for classification, regression, association

	finding K nearest neighbor:
		localising search
	outlier detection

consideration:
	partition criteria: single vs hierarchical
	separation: exclusive or non exclusive
	similarity: distance vs connectivity
	clustering: full space vs subspace

iterative relocation tech: improve quality by moving 1 object from 1 cluster to another

kmneas: applied to continous, sensitive to noisy and outlier

hierarchical:
	agglomerative(agnes)
	divisive(diana)

	uses dissimilaarity matrix and single link

measuring quality:
	extrinsic: supervised, recall and precision
	intrinsic: unsupervised, silhoutter coefficient

nbc adv: easy to implement, good result in most cases, fast to classify

disadv: conditional independence -> inaccurate

instance based:
	knn
	lazy learner
	robust to noisy data
	curse of dimensionality
	slow

if then classification:
	may have conflicts, resolve:
		size ordering
		classbased ordering
		rule based: make a priority list

exlcusive: each instance will be under only 1 class
exhaustive: there is rule for each combination of attributes

rule based: LHS-> RHS
	confition is conjunction

linear models:
	linear 
	logistic
	svm

holdout: test train split
	random sampling: variation of hold out: repeat hold out k times (with random sampling)

cross validation:
	k fold
	leave one out
	stratified sampling

bootstrap:
	for small data set
	random sampling
	0.632 

overcome imbalance:
	oversampling: increase tuple
	undersamping: reduce tuples
	threshold: move threshold to account for class
	ensemble

data mining task: specified in form of data mining query-> input dm system

dm query: in terms of dm task primitives, allow interactive communication.

dm task primitives:
	task relevant data
		db to look, tables to look, relevant attributes, data grouping
	kind of knowledge
		clustering, classification, regression
	background knowledge
		concept hierarchy:
			schema
			set grouping
			operation driven
			rule based
	interstingness measure:
		simplicity
		certainity
		novelty
		utility
	representation for visualising
		pixel oeriented
		geometric projection
		icon based
		hierarchy


dm query lang is designed for this

pattern interstingness:
	certainilty, novelity, useful, accurate
	interesting pattern -> knowledge
	measure:
		objective:
			confidence, support
		subjective:
			user's belief, unexpectedness, novelty, actionability

	simplicity: rule length, tree size
	certainity: confidence, accuracy, rule strength
	utility: usefullness, support, noise threshold
	novelty: surprising

principal of attribute oriented induction:
	data focusing
	attribute removal
	attribute generalisation
	atttrbite threshold control
	generalised relation threshold control

presentation of generalised results:
	relation
	cross tabulation nd visualisation
	quantitative characteristic rule

handle redundancy:
	because of integration from dbs
	same obj/attr may have diff name in diff db
	1 attr maybe derivable

	can handle by correlation/covariance analaysis 
	careful integration


cluster vs association => attribute vs appearance

frequent pattern: pattern/itemset taht occurs frequently

X is closed if X is frequent and no Y exist such that Y is superset of X and has same support as X

X is max pattern is X is frequenct and no frequenct Y superset of X 

downward closure property:
	if X is frequent then subset of X is frequent

scalable mining methods:
	apriori: bfs
	freq pattern growth: dfs
	vertical data format

handle:
	missing values:
		ignore
		manual
		global const
		central tendancy
		mean/median belonging to same class
		most probable value

	noisy:
		binning
		regression
		outlier analysis -> clustering

	data transformation starategy:
		smoothing
		attribute construction
		aggregation
		normalisation
		discretisation:
			binning
			histogram analysis
			cluster
			DT
		concept hierarchy

critique of atribute category:
	incomplete:
		assymetric
		cyclical
		mutlivariate
		partailly ordered
		partial memebership
		relationship bw data

characteristics of data
	dimensionality: no. of challenges
	sparsity: presence
	resolution: scale of data
	size of data

type of data:
	record:
		data matrix
		document data
		transaction data
	graph:
		www
		molecular structure
	ordered:
		spatial
		temporal
		sequential
		genetic sequence
